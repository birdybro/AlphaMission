# AlphaMission
Alpha Mission and clones FPGA core for MiSTer. This project code is a work in progress.
Tested with the following games:

| Game           |
| -------------  |
| ASO            |
| Alpha Mission  |
| Arian Mission  |

This core uses/is based on the following modules from other authors:

* jtopl by Jos√© Tejada [https://github.com/jotego/jtopl](https://github.com/jotego/jtopl)
* T80 Z80 CPU core by Daniel Wallner [https://opencores.org/projects/t80](https://opencores.org/projects/t80)
* 7400 TTL library by Tim Rudy [https://github.com/TimRudy/ice-chips-verilog](https://github.com/TimRudy/ice-chips-verilog)

# Introduction
The idea of creating this core was born for several reasons, the main ones being to find an affordable project that would allow me to progress in my knowledge of development in HDL languages and create an FPGA replica as faithful as possible of one of my favorite arcade games from my childhood. I started with a pcb from Alpha Mission and some photocopies of schematics from other similar games and a few months later all that work materialized here.
